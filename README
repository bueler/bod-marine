cont.txt:  need to make
   pism-dev/src/verif/tests/verifN/bodvardsson.c
into a petsc3.2 program, run it using the script
   pism-dev/src/verif/tests/verifN/conv.sh
and then link to the result conv.txt

ph.tex:  not clear what this should be but here is an idea:
   * title "Parabolic profiles and marine ice sheets"
   * merely mention for contrast/historical interest the Orowan&Nye parabola
   * address bodvardsson soln
   * verif test N type verification (grounded side only)
   * extend to marine exact solution with van der Veen
   * set up system using E() function as in marinethoughts.tex
   * stability analysis / numerical analysis of that
