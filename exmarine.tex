\title{An exact solution for a steady, flow-line marine ice sheet}

\abstract{In 1955 G.~Bodvardsson published a flow-line exact solution which, though this seems not to have been recognized before, is an exact solution to the simultaneous stress balance and mass continuity equations widely-used in numerical models of marine ice sheets.  Bodvardsson's solution, which has parabolic ice thickness and constant vertically-integrated longitudinal stress, solves the steady shallow shelf approximation on a flat bed.  It has elevation-dependent mass balance and location-dependent ice hardness.  By connecting Bodvardsson's solution to the \cite{vanderVeen83} solution for floating ice, we construct a steady solution to the ``rapid-sliding'' case of the marine ice sheet problem, essentially the model used in the MISMIP intercomparison \citep{MISMIP2012}.  We exploit the exact solution to examine the accuracy of a grid-free numerical method and a fully-implicit finite difference method, focussing especially on the approximation of the geometry and velocity in the vicinity of the grounding line.}

\subsection*{Introduction}  Early theoretical glaciology created two parabolic profiles as the shapes of steady flow-line ice sheets lying on flat beds, as in Figure \ref{fig:twoparabolas}.  One was the profile of an ice sheet with perfectly-plasticity \citep{Orowan,Nye52plastic} and the other the profile for a sliding ``plug'' flow investigated by \cite{Bodvardsson}.  These global views of free surface flows in glaciology focus on different aspects of the global problem, and they come to very different conclusions.\footnote{Draft date \emph{\today}.}

These parabolas, which exactly solve the nonlinear flow equations for geometry, shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoparabolas}.  Up to scaling, one is of the form $x=1-y^2$ (Orowan-Nye) and the other is of the form $y=1-x^2$ (Bodvardsson).  The former perfect-plasticity solution has a central peak at the highest point of the ice sheet, and a margin with unbounded surface gradient.  The plug flow solution has a smooth dome and a finite-slope, wedge-shaped margin.

\end{figure}

This paper combines Bodvardsson's solution with the well-known exact solution for an ice shelf \citep{vanderVeen83,vanderVeen} to generate an exact solution for a flowline, steady marine ice sheet.  The result, shown in Figure \ref{fig:exactmarine}, is an exact solution of the steady equations for the rapidly-sliding marine ice sheet case \citep{SchoofMarine1} which is addressed by the MISMIP intercomparison \citep{MISMIP2012}.  This exact solution simultaneously solves the steady mass continuity equation and the so-called shallow shelf approximation (``SSA''; Weis and others, 1999).\nocite{WeisGreveHutter}


\subsection*{Continuum model}

Our continuum model is the steady-state, flat bed form of the flowline, rapid-sliding model of Schoof\nocite{SchoofMarine1} (2007; equations (2.1)--(2.5)).  We restrict to the linear sliding case, but with a reasonably general sliding coefficient.  The primary unknowns in these equations are the ice thickness $H(x)$, velocity $u(x)$, and vertically-integrated longitudinal stress $T(x)$ \citep{SchoofStream}, where $x$ is the flowline distance.  Using other notation from Table \ref{tab:notation}, the equations are
\begin{gather}
(uH)_x - M = 0, \label{eq:steadymass} \\
T_x - \beta u - \rho g H h_x = 0, \label{eq:steadySSA} \\
T = 2 B H |u_x|^{\frac{1}{n}-1} u_x, \label{eq:Tstress}
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
h = \begin{cases} H+b,            & \rho H \ge \rho_w (z_o - b) \\
                  \omega H + z_o, & \rho H < \rho_w (z_o - b) \end{cases}, \label{eq:surface} \\
\beta = \begin{cases} k \rho g H,    & \rho H \ge \rho_w (z_o - b) \\
                      0,          & \rho H < \rho_w (z_o - b) \end{cases}. \label{eq:betafull}
\end{gather}
These equations apply on an interval $0 < x < x_c$ where $x_c$ is the floating calving-front.  The grounded ice rests on flat bedrock at elevation $b$.  Note $M(x)$ combines the surface and basal mass balance and $B(x)$ is the ice hardness, and these may depend on location.  In grounded ice the basal shear stress satisfies $\tau_b = - \beta u$ \citep{MacAyeal}, but here we scale the coefficient with the ice overburden pressure so that $\beta = k \rho g H$ \citep{Bodvardsson}.  The ``Archimedean factor'' $\omega = 1 - \rho/\rho_w$ relates surface elevation and thickness in floating ice and $z=z_o$ is the elevation of the ocean surface.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\onecol{exactmarine-geometry}
\caption{The geometry (solid) and velocity (dashed) of an exact solution of the simultaneous steady mass continuity and SSA stress balance equations for a marine ice sheet.  It is Bodvardsson's parabola when grounded and van der Veen's solution when floating.} \label{fig:exactmarine}
\end{figure}

Equations \eqref{eq:steadymass} and \eqref{eq:steadySSA} are the mass-continuity and SSA stress balance equations, respectively, while \eqref{eq:Tstress} defines $T$.  The grounding line $x=x_g$ is a location which must be solved-for, but there we have $\rho H = \rho_w (z_o - b)$.  Equation \eqref{eq:surface} says that the ice surface $z=h$ is at elevation $H+b$ when the ice is grounded, and otherwise the ice surface $z=h$ is found from the Archimedean principle.  Likewise equation \eqref{eq:betafull} gives the scaled form of the basal shear stress for grounded ice and otherwise zero.

For the exact and numerical solutions in this paper, equations \eqref{eq:steadymass}--\eqref{eq:betafull} are augmented by boundary conditions:
\begin{gather}
u(0) = u_a > 0, \quad H(0) = H_a > 0, \label{eq:leftbc} \\
T(x_c) = \frac{1}{2} \omega \rho g H(x_c)^2,  \label{eq:rightbc} \\
H, u, T \quad \text{ continuous at } x = x_g.  \label{eq:xgregularity}
\end{gather}
Here $x=0$ is an upstream location where a Dirichlet boundary condition is applied to the (coupled) problem of determining velocity and thickness, while at the (non-moving) calving front $x_c$ we have the standard hydrostatic pressure ``imbalance'' condition \citep{SchoofMarine1}.  Fact \eqref{eq:xgregularity} at $x_g$ is actually a regularity requirement, not strictly a boundary condition; see below.  By equation \eqref{eq:Tstress}, $T$ is continuous at $x_g$ if and only if $u_x$ is continuous at $x_g$ \citep{SchoofMarine1}.

Given data $B(x)$, $b$, $k>0$, $M(x)$, $x_c>0$, $z_o$, along with physical constants $g,n,\rho,\rho_w$, we expect the problem consisting of equations \eqref{eq:steadymass}--\eqref{eq:xgregularity} to be well-posed.  To our knowledge this has not been proved, nor do we attempt to prove it.  It is, however, worth considering the smoothness (regularity) of the solution, including what hypotheses would lead to satisfying \eqref{eq:xgregularity}, noting that the grounding line is an unknown point inside the domain.  Suppose that, for \emph{a priori} physical reasons, the mass balance $M(x)$ and ice hardness $B(x)$ are bounded and integrable, and further that $B(x)$ is bounded below by a positive constant.  From integrating $M$, equation \eqref{eq:steadymass} implies that the flux $q=uH$ is absolutely-continuous and thus bounded.  If there is an \emph{a priori} positive lower bound on thickness $H$, a function which we must assume is integrable, then we can conclude that the magnitude of $u$ is bounded because $u=q/H$.  If there is also an \emph{a priori} bound on the magnitude of the driving stress $-\rho g H h_x$ then equation \eqref{eq:steadySSA} implies $T$ is absolutely-continuous.  By equation \eqref{eq:Tstress} this implies $u$ has a bounded and integrable derivative, and thus that it is also absolutely-continuous.  From these facts we could then return to the flux and write $H=q/u$ which shows $H$ is absolutely-continuous away from locations where $u=0$ (e.g.~divides).  In summary, assuming \emph{(i)} that an integrable solution $(H,u,T)$ to \eqref{eq:steadymass}--\eqref{eq:Tstress} exists, \emph{(ii)} that the functions $M,B$ are bounded and integrable, \emph{(iii)} that $B$ is bounded below by a positive constant, \emph{(iv)} that a positive lower bound on thickness exists, and \emph{(v)} that an upper bound on the magnitude of the driving stress exists, then we can regard condition \eqref{eq:xgregularity}, giving the continuity at the grounding line, as properties of the solution instead of as part of the ``imposed'' problem statement.

\subsection*{Bodvardsson's parabola}

FIXME

The \cite{Bodvardsson} solution is also a parabola, but this time the margin has finite slope and the dome is smooth.  The \cite{Bodvardsson} solution was analyzed by \cite{Weertman61stability}, who decides that the physics chosen by Bodvardsson should be replaced by more SIA-like deformation, though sliding is allowed as well.

Bodvardsson doesn't actual solve the SIA but instead solves a plug-flow model with a basal velocity which is proportional to the glaciological driving stress.  The SIA with Glen (power) law rheology is stated in his equation (13).  The ice softness is parameterized in equation (1) by $S_0$, the ``pseudo yield stress'' for power law ice.  Thus his equation (13) has constants $n$ and $S_0$, as well as constant $k$ describing the basal sliding.  But he then says on page 4, regarding his equation (13): ``This equation is quite tedious and very difficult to handle especially because of the first term in the parentheses.  It is therefore fortunate that this term appears to be small compared to the second term.''  In the next paragraph he drops the ``first term in the parentheses,'' and thus drops the Glen law and any internal ice deformation at all, and writes down equation (14) with only the constant ``$k$'' describing the base.  He never goes back to SIA equation (13), nor are any solutions of equation (13) provided.

Regarding the ``$k$'' in equation, and noting that his actual results are all on a flat bed, he says between his equation (9) and (10): ``$s_b = k v w h$''.  In modern symbols we would write the shear stress applied to the base of the ice as
  $$\tau_b = - k u_b \rho g H$$
This a linear sliding relation $\tau_b = - \beta u_b$ where $\beta = k (\rho g H).$.  That is, $\beta$ scales with the overburden pressure.

But equations (14) and (16) and (17), for which he discusses stability, are not SIA.  The involve no ice deformation at all, nor are stresses in the ice balanced in any way.  His flows are \emph{plug flows} with a weak fluid which feels only linear basal resistance.

Bodvardsson's solution (18) of (17) is exact.

\emph{But} the quadratic solution (18) absolutely does not have a margin
shape which would come from deformation and Glen's law.  Rather his
margin is asymptotically a ``wedge'' with finite slope, because his ice
sheet profile is merely a parabola \emph{in the horizontal variable} $x$.
See the profile in figure 2 for the margin shape, the last 20km of
Bruarjokull.

Bodvardsson's parabola must be the opposite end of some spectrum from the
purely-plastic, $n=\infty$ ice which gives a shape which is a parabola
on its side, that is, a square root in $x$!  In particular, Bodvardsson's equation (23) gives an exact solution of his equation (17), and this is shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoparabolas}.  FIXME: form with $L$ and $H_0$ needed for reference from Figure \ref{fig:twoparabolas}.

\citet[equation (17)]{Bodvardsson} writes 
\begin{equation}
a (H - H_{ela}) + (k^{-1} H H')' = 0  \label{bodsteady}
\end{equation}
for $k>0$ and $a>0$ and equilibrium-line altitude $H_{ela}$.  The offered solution \citep[equation (23)]{Bodvardsson} is
\begin{equation}
H(x) = H_0 (1 - (x/L_0)^2)  \label{bodsoln}
\end{equation}
where $H_0 = 1.5 H_{ela}$ and $a k L_0^2 = 9 H_{ela}$.  This is an exact solution to equation \eqref{bodsteady} with boundary condition $H(0)=H_0$, as the reader may verify.  Formula \eqref{bodsoln} defines the dashed parabola shown in Figure \ref{fig:twoparabolas}.

In the Bodvardsson theory the ice velocity is
\begin{equation}
u = - \frac{1}{k} H' \label{bodstressbalance}
\end{equation}
and the surface mass balance is
\begin{equation}
M = a (H - H_{ela}).  \label{bodmassbalance}
\end{equation}
This same surface balance appears in \cite{Weertman61stability,Jouvetetal2011}, among other places, and, though realisting in its broad outlines, it is generally understood to be a source of instability for the problem of determining the steady state of an ice sheet.

Bodvardsson explicitly considers solution \eqref{bodsoln} to solve a free boundary problem.  Specifically, the sense is that the single boundary condition $H(0)=H_0$, in the equation \eqref{bodsteady}, determines the quadratic solution \eqref{bodsoln}, which generates a value for $L_0$ from the hypothesis that the flux at $x=L_0$ is zero and the thickness at $x=L_0$ is also zero.  A DEEPER REASON WHY \eqref{bodsteady} SHOULD HAVE A QUADRATIC SOLUTION IS NOT OFFERED.

A MODERN RE-INTERPETATION  The solution \eqref{bodsoln} exactly solves a combination of the flow-line mass-continuity equation and the SSA stress balance \citep{MacAyeal,WeisGreveHutter}, but with somewhat-contrived (``manufactured'') sliding coefficient and ice softness.

We write flow-line mass-continuity equation and SSA stress balance equations together as a system describing a steady grounded flow with sliding.  The SSA is a balance of vertically-integrated longitudinal stresses, basal shear stress, and glaciological driving stress.  Specifically we assume flat bed and linear sliding $\tau_b = -\beta u$ and get:
\begin{align}
M - (u H)_x &= 0 \label{mcsteady} \\
\left(2 H B |u_x|^{(1/n)-1} u_x\right)_x - \beta u &= \rho g H H_x  \label{ssasteady}
\end{align}
Such a model will be familiar to many readers as the steady state form of the model used in much recent work on marine ice sheet flowline models \citep[e.g.][]{SchoofMarine1}.  In equations \eqref{mcsteady} and \eqref{ssasteady} we see a non-linearly viscous constitutive relation for the ice.  A balance is required in which only the along-flow deviatoric (``longitudinal'') stress
	$$\tau = 2 \nu u_x$$
appears, but not the vertical shear stress.  In this isothermal case, Glen's power law for ice flow implies
	$$\nu = B |u_x|^{(1/n)-1}$$
where $B$ is the ice hardness.  Following \cite{SchoofStream} we define the vertically-integrated longitudinal stress
\begin{equation}
T = \tau H = 2 H B |u_x|^{(1/n)-1} u_x.  \label{schoofsT}
\end{equation}

We now consider equations \eqref{mcsteady}, \eqref{ssasteady} in the case of specific mass balance \eqref{bodmassbalance}.
Furthermore let us suppose a sliding coefficient which scales with the overburden pressure,
\begin{equation}
\beta = \beta(x) = k \rho g H(x),\label{betadefine}
\end{equation}
where $k>0$ is a constant.  With these substitutions the system \eqref{ssasteady} appears as
\begin{align}
a(H-H_{ela}) - (u H)_x &= 0 \label{mcsteadysimpler} \\
\left(T\right)_x - k \rho g H u &= \rho g H H_x \label{ssasteadysimpler}
\end{align}

Now suppose that we consider only solutions with constant vertically-integrated longitudinal stress, $T_x \equiv 0$.  In that case a brief calculation reduces equations \eqref{ssasteadysimpler} to Bodvardsson's model, equation \eqref{bodsteady} above.  That is, if $T_x \equiv 0$ then we recover a parabolic profile for $H(x)$, namely equation \eqref{bodsoln}.

What does the condition ``$T_x\equiv 0$'' imply as a relation among the modeled quantities?  Given a thickness profile $H(x)$ and a strain rate profile $u_x(x)$, we may interpret ``$T_x\equiv 0$'' as a statement about \emph{variable ice hardness}.  Such variable hardness is physical and common to many models using the SSA \citep{BBssasliding}, so implementing such $x$-dependent hardness requires no new concepts or components in such models.  In particular, if $T=T_0$ is the constant value then equation \eqref{schoofsT} implies
\begin{equation}
B = B(x) = \frac{T_0}{2 H |u_x|^{(1/n)-1} u_x}. \label{hardnessdefine}
\end{equation}

We are now in the following extraordinary situation.  Given Bodvardsson's formula \eqref{bodsoln} for $H(x)$, and computing the horizontal velocity $u(x)$ by the simple rule from \cite{Bodvardsson},
	$$u = -\frac{1}{k} H',$$
we can construct a nontrivial solution to the steady SSA-plus-mass continuity system \eqref{ssasteady}.  Namely, we define the linear friction coefficient $\beta$ by equation \eqref{betadefine} and the ice hardness $B$ by equation \eqref{hardnessdefine}, and regard these as the fixed functions of $x$ shown in Figure \ref{fig:bodverifbetaB}.  The resulting profiles of elevation and horizontal velocity solve a nontrivial problem with a flat base and a surface mass balance function depending linearly on elevation, namely system \eqref{ssasteadysimpler}.  These profiles are shown in Figure FIXME.

The surface mass balance is, in this Test N case, a fixed function of $x$ also, in which we have incorporated solution \eqref{bodsoln},
	$$M = M(x) = a(H-H_{ela}) = a(H_0(1 - (x/L_0)^2 - H_{ela}).$$
By using this simple parabolic surface mass balance we remove one instability from the continuum problem, namely the accumulation-altitude feedback which was Bodavardsson's original purpose.  But we can put it back when needed.

\end{figure}


WHAT IS Bodvardsson's ACTUAL STABILITY RESULT?:  Bodvardsson treats the stability problem for equation (16) by showing that his free boundary solution (18) is linearly-UNstable.

FOR VERIFICATION PURPOSES WE CAN FIX $M(x)$ TO ITS BODVARDSSON VALUE, AND REMOVE ANY ISSUES WITH INSTABILITY.

FOR THE SOLUTION FROM THE PREVIOUS SUBSECTION WE HAVE BOTH THE ELEVATION-ALTITUDE AND THE MARINE ICE SHEET INSTABILITY, IF WE ADD TIME-DEPENDENCE.

A special-purpose, stand-alone C code implementing a second-order finite difference scheme is described in the appendix.  It is also available as part of the PISM source code.  It has a parallel implementation using the PETSc \citep{petsc-user-ref} library and it uses a Newton scheme to achieve observed quadratic convergence of the iteration.

Figure \ref{fig:verifNresult} shows the result of using this numerical scheme to approximate the exact solution.  Both the maximum numerical thickness error and the maximum numerical velocity error are observed to converge at essentially an $O(\Delta x^2)$ error as the grid spacing $\Delta x$ refines to zero.

\subsection*{Conclusions} BLAH BLAH

\subsection*{Acknowledgements and erratum}  Thanks to Heinz Blatter and Helgi Bj\"ornsson for tracking down the original paper by Bodvardsson.  \cite{BLKCB} identify the constant accumulation SIA solution as ``Bodvarsson (1955)--Vialov (1958).''  This is incorrect as it is attributable only to Vialov.  Also, the spelling of Bodvardsson's name is ``Bodvarsson'' in many places, but the original paper in 1955 has ``Bodvardsson'' with a ``d''.  \cite{Weertman61stability}, an early response to Bodvardsson's work, drops the ``d''.

\appendix

\subsection{Appendix A: Bodvardsson's little theorem}  \cite{Bodvardsson} does not identify the source of the exact parabolic thickness solution to his plug flow equations, and it seems likely that he derived the solution from scratch.  We summarize his result as the theorem that if $A$ and $B$ are constant then there is a unique polynomial solution $y(x)$ to the nonlinear second-order differential equation
\begin{equation}
  (y y')' = Ay+B  \label{eq:abstractode}
\end{equation}
satisfying the single boundary condition $y(0) = y_0 > 0$ and additional technical conditions $y'(0) \le 0$ and $2A y_0 + 3 B \ge 0$.  Equation \eqref{eq:abstractode} is Bodvarssson's equation ``(17).''  The additional technical conditions are unstated other than the claim that his problem ``define[s] one and only one solution which is admittable from the physical point of view'' \citep{Bodvardsson}.  In this appendix we justify this little theorem and, following Bodvardsson, we derive relations among parameters which yield the solution.  The existence of the unique polynomial solution to this problem allows its interpretation as a free boundary problem which determines the first positive zero $x_0>0$ of $y(x)$.  In Bodvardsson's context $x_0=L_0$ is the length of the glacier, equivalently the location of the ice sheet margin in the ``dry'' case where flotation does not occur.

It is easy to see by substitution into \eqref{eq:abstractode} that nontrivial solutions of degree $d$, i.e.~of the form $y(x) = \gamma x^d + (\text{lower degree})$ with $\gamma\ne 0$, exist only if $d=2$.  In that case we seek solutions which satisfy the boundary conditions, so
\begin{equation}
y(x) = y_0(1 - \alpha x + \beta x^2)  \label{eq:abstractsoln}
\end{equation}
for some $\alpha\ge 0$ and $\beta$ which are to be determined from $A,B$; this is Bodvarssson's solution ``(18).''  Substitution gives the two equations
\begin{equation}
3 y_0^2 \alpha^2 = 2 A y_0 + 3 B \quad \text{ and } \quad 6 y_0 \beta = A.  \label{eq:abstractrelations}
\end{equation}
These two relations determine $\alpha,\beta$ from $A,B$.  The first relation explains a technical condition as ensuring that $\alpha$ is real.

In the main text, Bodvardsson's problem relates the initial (upstream) ice thickness $y_0=H_0$, an ablation gradient $a>0$, the equilibrium-line altitude $H_{ela}$, and a sliding constant $k>0$ to the glacier thickness $y(x) = H(x)$.  He has $A=-ka$ and $B=k a H_{ela}$ in \eqref{eq:abstractode} so the technical condition $2A y_0 + 3 B \ge 0$ says $3 H_{ela} \ge 2 H_0$ after simplification.  This causes the equilibrium line altitude to be relatively high on the glacier.


\subsection{Appendix: a finite difference scheme}  The steady-state equations for mass continuity \eqref{eq:steadymass} and stress balance \eqref{eq:steadySSA} form a coupled system that can be approximately solved by the numerical scheme described here.  It uses centered, second-order finite differences for both equations.

We define an equally-spaced grid on the domain $[x_a,x_c]$.  Because the boundary condition at the calving front evaluates the stress $T$, the right endpoint $x_c$ is at a ``staggered'' location halfway in-between grid points.  Let $L=x_c-x_a$.  If $N$ is an integer then we define $\Delta x = L / (N+1/2)$ and $x_j = x_a + j\Delta x$ for $j=0,\dots,N+1$.  Denote the numerical approximations $H_i\approx H(x_i)$ and $u_i \approx u(x_i)$.  Let $x_j^* = x_j + \Delta x/2$ be the staggered location, for $j=0,\dots,N$, and note $x_c = x_N^* < x_{N+1}$.  Denote $B_j^*=B(x_j^*)$ and $M_j^*=M(x_j^*)$.

The mass continuity equation \eqref{eq:steadymass} is approximated by a second-order method centered at the staggered location.  For $j=0,\dots,N$,
\begin{equation}
\frac{u_{j+1} H_{j+1} - u_j H_j}{\Delta x} - M_j^* = 0 \label{eq:steadymassFD}
\end{equation}

In equation \eqref{eq:steadySSA} we avoid infinite viscosity by regularization \citep{SchoofStream}.  Let $\eps=1/L$ per year, i.e.~a strain rate corresponding to 1 m$/$a velocity change over the whole domain, $q = (1-n)/n$, and define
\begin{equation}
F(u_l,u_r) = \left(\left(\frac{u_r-u_l}{\Delta x}\right)^2 + \eps^2\right)^{q/2} \frac{u_r-u_l}{\Delta x}. \label{eq:viscregFD}
\end{equation}
Then we approximate the stress $T$ at staggered points,
\begin{equation}
T_j^* = 2 B_j^* \left(\frac{H_j + H_{j+1}}{2}\right) F(u_j,u_{j+1}), \label{eq:TFD}
\end{equation}
for $j=0,\dots,N$, and equation \eqref{eq:steadySSA} is approximated by
\begin{equation}
\frac{T_j^* - T_{j-1}^*}{\Delta x} - \beta_j u_j - \rho g H_j \frac{h_{j+1} - h_{j-1}}{2 \Delta x} = 0 \label{eq:steadySSAFD}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_j = k \rho g H_j$ if the ice is grounded at $x_j$ (i.e.~if $\rho H_j \ge \rho_w (z_o - b)$) and $\beta_j=0$ if the ice is floating, and where $h_j = H_j + b$ if the ice is grounded and $h_j = \omega H_j + z_o$ if the ice is floating.  Equation \eqref{eq:steadySSAFD} applies as stated both for grounded and floating ice, and it applies for all interior regular points, thus for $j=1,\dots,N$.

At this point we have $2N+4$ unknowns, namely $u_j,H_j$ for $j=0,\dots,N+1$.  There are $2N+1$ nonlinear equations in \eqref{eq:steadymassFD} and \eqref{eq:steadySSAFD} above.  The two upstream Dirichlet equations \eqref{eq:leftbc}, namely $u_0=u_a$ and $H_0=H_a$, and an approximation of the calving front condition \eqref{eq:rightbc} complete the system.  For the last one we write
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \omega \rho g \left(\frac{H_N + H_{N+1}}{2}\right)^2 = T_N^* \label{eq:rightbcFD}
\end{equation}
where $T_N^*$ is the approximation given in \eqref{eq:TFD}.

We now have a system of $2N+4$ equations in the same number of unknowns, which we can write abstractly as $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{v})=0$.  These equations are solved by Newton's method \citep{Kelley} as implemented in PETSc \citep{petsc-user-ref}.  We first write a residual evaluation function which merely computes $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{v})$ given $\mathbf{v}$, and a finite-difference Jacobian can be computed by PETSc, so this allows us to solve systems up to size about $N=1000$.  (It is critical in this finite-difference Jacobian case that the equations $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{v})=0$ are scaled so that both the unknowns $\mathbf{v}$ and the ``residuals'', namely the output values of $\mathbf{F}$, have values which are $O(1)$.)  For higher resolution WE NEED AN ANALYTICAL JACOBIAN (FIXME).  FOR 2D CASES PERHAPS PRECONDITIONING BY AN APPROXIMATION TO THE JACOBIAN WOULD BE WISE.  

FIXME: WHAT ABOUT INITIAL GUESS?
