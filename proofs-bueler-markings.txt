The page proofs look quite good!

I have listed corrections below at the end of this email.  The attached scanned
PDF is auxiliary, to confirm/corroborate the corrections listed below.

I will return these in my next email.

I think the current technical article is not a good candidate for such
treatment.


Regarding the corrections below, I realize I made one systematic mistake which
I have attempted to correct.  Namely, I had several enumerated lists within the
text which I wrote as "(1) first item, (2) second item, ..."  This is confusing
because "(1)" indicates Eqn (1).  So I have changed the style to "(i) first item,
(ii) second item, ..." and so on.  See below.


------- CORRECTIONS: --------

page 1, Abstract, 4th line:  "equally spaced" --> "equally-spaced"

page 1, Introduction, 4th line:  There is a reference here to a possibly-oral comment by
Orowan at a 1949 British Glaciological Society meeting, which was then written
down by someone for the minutes.  I think that for clarity the in-text citation
should say "(Orowan, 1949)" not "(British Glaciological Society, 1949)",
even if the BGS was the "author" of the minutes (and their publisher).
At several points I refer, *accurately*, to the "Orowan-Nye" solution, so the
reader will be confused by the current citation.

page 1, Introduction, 6th line:  "(investigated by Bodvarsson, 1955)" -->
"(Bodvarsson, 1955)"

page 1, Introduction, 13th line:  "The latter, plug-flow, solution" --> "The
latter plug-flow solution"

page 1, Introduction, 2nd paragraph, 12th line:  "errors using two different"
--> "errors from two different"

page 1, Continuum model, subheading: "*Model" --> "Model"

page 1, Continuum model, 1st paragraph, 3rd line from end:  "floating ice so"
--> "floating ice, so"

page 1, Continuum model, 2nd paragraph, 2nd line:  "floating ice and let z_o"
--> "floating ice.  Let z_o"

page 1, Continuum model, 2nd paragraph, 4th line:  "which in this paper we
assume is a constant" --> "which is a constant in this paper"

page 2, caption of Figure 1:  "(British Glaciological Society, 1949;" -->
"(Orowan, 1949;"

page 2, first paragraph, Eqn (8) and the line following:  Put comma at end of
Eqn (8).  Then put this after Eqn (8):  "where u_a and H_a simply denote
boundary values for velocity and thickness, respectively."

page 2, paragraph before Exact solution section, 15th line:  Fix item numbering:
"(1) that an integrable" --> "(i) that an integrable" AND "(ii) that the
functions" AND "(iii) that B is bounded" AND "(iv) that a positive" AND "(v)
that an upper"

page 2, paragraph before Exact solution section, last line:  "grounding line,
x_g, as part of the solution only." --> "grounding line, x_g, unknown, and with
Eqn (8) only describing properties of the solution."

page 2, very last line:  "stress within" --> "stresses within"
