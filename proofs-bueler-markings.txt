The page proofs look quite good!

I have listed corrections below at the end of this email.  The attached scanned
PDF is auxiliary, to confirm/corroborate the corrections listed below.

I will return these in my next email.

I think the current technical article is not a good candidate for such
treatment.


Regarding the corrections below, I have tried to systematically correct a
mistake in the proofs.  The several enumerated lists within the text should not
appear as "(1) first item, (2) second item, ..."  This is confusing because
"(1)" indicates Eqn (1).  So I have changed the style to "(i) first item,
(ii) second item, ..." and so on.  See below.


------- CORRECTIONS, ORGANIZED BY PAGE NUMBER IN PROOFS: --------

*** PAGE 1 ***

Abstract, 4th line:  "equally spaced" --> "equally-spaced"

1st column, 4th line:  There is a reference here to a possibly-oral comment by
Orowan at a 1949 British Glaciological Society meeting, which was then written
down by someone for the minutes.  I think that for clarity the in-text citation
should say "(Orowan, 1949)" not "(British Glaciological Society, 1949)",
even if the BGS was the "author" of the minutes (and their publisher).
At several points I refer, *accurately*, to the "Orowan-Nye" solution, so the
reader will be confused by the current citation.

1st column, 6th line:  "(investigated by Bodvarsson, 1955)" -->
"(Bodvarsson, 1955)"

1st column, 13th line:  "The latter, plug-flow, solution" --> "The
latter plug-flow solution"

1st column, 2nd paragraph, 12th line:  "errors using two different"
--> "errors from two different"

Continuum model, the subheading: "*Model" --> "Model"

2nd column, 1st paragraph, 3rd line from end:  "floating ice so"
--> "floating ice, so"

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, 2nd line:  "floating ice and let z_o"
--> "floating ice.  Let z_o"

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, 4th line:  "which in this paper we
assume is a constant" --> "which is a constant in this paper"


*** PAGE 2 ***

caption of Figure 1:  "(British Glaciological Society, 1949;" -->
"(Orowan, 1949;"

1st column, Eqn (8) and the line following:  Put comma at end of
Eqn (8).  Then put this after Eqn (8):  "where u_a and H_a simply denote
boundary values for velocity and thickness, respectively."

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, 15th line:  Fix item numbering:
"(1) that an integrable" --> "(i) that an integrable",
"(2)" --> "(ii)",  "(3)" --> "(iii)",  "(4)" --> "(iv)",  "(5)" --> "(v)"

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, last line:  "grounding line,
x_g, as part of the solution only." --> "grounding line, x_g, unknown, and with
Eqn (8) only describing properties of the solution."

very last line:  "stress within" --> "stresses within"


*** PAGE 3 ***

1st column, line 5:  "balanced entirely by" --> "balanced by"

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, line 3:  "but Eqn (11) may be mysterious." -->
"but the source of Eqn (11) may be less clear."

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, line 10:  Fix item numbering:  "(1)" --> "(i)",
"(2)" --> "(ii)",  "(3)" --> "(iii)"

2nd column, 3rd paragraph, line 10:  "can use the exact" --> "can therefore use
the exact"

2nd column, 3rd paragraph, line 11:  "requiring special modifications to
incorporate variable hardness." --> "requiring unusual modifications."

2nd column, 4th paragraph, line 6:  "in Eqn (14) can be set" --> "in Eqn (14)
will be set"

2nd column, 5th paragraph, line 2:  Fix item numbering:  "(1)" --> "(i)",
"(2)" --> "(ii)"


*** PAGE 4 ***

caption of Figure 3:  Yes, it is o.k. for the Table to have units  m s^{-1}  for
M and have the axis label instead by  m a^{-1}.

1st column, line 2:  Yes, it is o.k. to replace T_o with T_0.

1st column, line 5:  Add comma:  "x_g \le x \le x_c a constant," -->
"x_g \le x \le x_c, a constant,"

1st column, 2nd paragraph, 3rd line:  "comes from combining" --> "combines"

1st column, 2nd paragraph, 6th line (just after Eqn (16)):  "where u_s(x) is"
--> "where the ice shelf velocity u_s(x) is"

2nd column, Table 2:  As indicated in the caption of Table 2, it is important
that the reader can see which quantities are "used in" the equations and which
are "determined by".  This distinguishes between the inputs of the mathematical
model and its outputs.  Therefore there should be a horizontal line between the
"u(0)" line and the "x_g" line.  In the caption, "(top)" should be "(above
divider)", or similar, and "(bottom)" should be "(below divider)".  If this
structure is unacceptable for some reason then the Table should be split in two.

2nd column, Table 2:  The "Units" column label should be replaced by "Value and
Units".

2nd column, Table 2:  The "Units" (now "Value and Units") entry for "B(x_g)" has
become wrapped.  This should be avoided.


*** PAGE 5 ***

2nd column, 1st paragraph, line 7:  Add comma:  "to many digits despite" -->
"to many digits, despite"

2nd column, 2nd paragraph, line 4:  Remove commas, add "an", and italicize:
"we avoid, a priori, choice of" --> "we avoid an \emph{a priori} choice of"

2nd column, 3rd paragraph, line 4:  "we get the results shown" --> "we get the
numerical error shown"


*** PAGE 6 ***

1st column, 3rd paragraph, line 4:  "the exact solution (u_0, H_0, T_0)" -->
"the exact solution by (\hat u, \hat H, \hat T)"

1st column, Eqn (19):  replace power "q" with "p" in upper left matrix entry

1st column, line after Eqn (19):  "where $q = \frac{1}{n} - 1$."  -->  "where
$p = \frac{1}{n} - 1$."

2nd column, 3rd paragraph, 1st line:  "equally spaced" --> "equally-spaced"


*** PAGE 7 ***

1st column, 1st paragraph of Conclusion, last line:  Strike "for verification".

1st column, 2nd paragraph of Conclusion, 5th line:  "even though most early"
--> "even though other early"

2nd column, 1st entry in References:  "Balay S and 10 others" --> "Balay S and
13 others".

2nd column, 3rd entry in References:  Again, I assert it should be made clear
that I am referring to a comment by E. Orowan, within a BGS meeting report.


*** PAGE 8 ***

1st column, Leguy et al entry:  This has appeared in The Cryosphere.  Here is

1st column, 1st paragraph, Eqn (B2):  Replace power "q/2" by "(1-n)/(2n)".
